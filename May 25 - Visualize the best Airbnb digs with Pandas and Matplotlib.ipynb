    "# May 25th - Visualize the best Airbnb digs with Pandas and Matplotlib\n",
    "*© 2022 Colin Conrad*\n",
    "\n",
    "Last week we explored how to use _libraries_ to make our lives easier, as well as some of the Python basics. We used these skills to import CSV files into our Python framework to conduct some basic data cleaning. With this knowledge in hand, you are now ready to start working with data more earnestly. This week we will use `Pandas` the most common Python data frame library, often used by data scientists and researchers to conduct their day-to-day activities. The [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/getting_started/index.html#getting-started) dataframe is a tool which makes it easier to navigate and analyze large datasets. Built upon numpy and other dependencies, this tool is among the most essential resources for conducting analysis on larger datasets. Like basic Python, we will use this tool in nearly all subsequent exercises, so be sure to watch this one closely.\n",
    "\n",
    "**This week, we will achieve the following objectives:**\n",
    "- Turn your dataset into a dataframe and build a simple query\n",
    "- Observe additional features and create an advanced query\n",
    "- Collect descriptive statistics from your dataframe\n",
    "- Make changes to your dataframe\n",
    "- Visualize the price of Airbnb in Manhattan\n",

    "# Case: Airbnb\n",
    "It's pretty likely that you know something about [Airbnb](https://www.airbnb.ca/). Airbnb has been called the [world's largest hotel chain](https://www.bizjournals.com/sanfrancisco/news/2017/08/11/airbnb-surpasses-ihg-wyn-hilton-marriott-listings.html), while owning no hotels themselves. As a crowdsourcing platform, users can list their properties and rent them out to short-term renters using the Airbnb app. Though the company is not yet 13 years old as of January 2021, it has a market valuation of $113 billion, nearly 13 times the estimated value of Hilton hotel brands (the most valuable hotel chain).\n",
    "\n",
    "Airbnb is not without controversy. Airbnb has been identified by the [Economic Policy Institute](https://www.epi.org/publication/the-economic-costs-and-benefits-of-airbnb-no-reason-for-local-policymakers-to-let-airbnb-bypass-tax-or-regulatory-obligations/) as an important factor in rising rent an property prices, despite often escaping tax and regulation. The company [regularly releases their application data publicly](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html). Though we cannot investigate this phenomenon in one lab, this is a useful resource for learning about data science tools."

    "# Objective 1: Turn your dataset into a dataframe and build a simple query\n",
    "As discussed in class, pandas is a framework built on top of the numpy library designed to make data science easier. Numpy is a tool for transforming your data into a multi-dimensional array, sort of like a hyper-efficient Python list. It's not great to use unless you are interested in going deep into machine learning. The pandas (PANel + DAta) library transforms our data into numerical tables (a.k.a. data frames) which are easier to calculate and sort through. We will start with Pandas because this is the tool that will be most useful for us.\n",

In pandas, a subset is declared by writing square brackets following the data frame-- for instance, `nyc['neighbourhood_group']` would return the values of neighborhood. However, we can also use this to conduct Boolean searches as well. For instance, if we wanted to retrieve only the values where `neighbourhood_group == Brooklyn` we could write a query as follows."

    "Finally, we are now ready to visualize the data. Pandas dataframes have built-in functions for conducting visualizations that leverage a popular data visualization library callend `matplotlib`. We will explore this library in more detail moving forward, but I wanted to conclude this week's session by giving you a taste of what it can do. In this case, we may wish to find which specific neighbourhoods in Manhattan have good Airbnb deals. Let's start by taking a subsegment of our dataframe."

To create an effective visualization, we may wish to simplify our data, such as by calculating the median value of each neighbourhood. Fortunately, Pandas has the `groupby` function. The code below splits the data into groups according to the neighbourhood. We can use this to calculate the median values and visualize these in more detail.\n",
