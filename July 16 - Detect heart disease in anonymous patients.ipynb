    "# July 16th - Detect heart disease in anonymous patients\n",
    "*© 2022 Colin Conrad*\n",
    "\n",
    "We have made so much progress in the past six weeks. In this final session, we will dig a bit more deeply into data mining by drawing from our visualization and statistics skills, but most importantly, but exploring _classification_. This technique is one of the common tasks of machine learning, a whole world onto itself. The objective of classification is to train a computer algorithm that can detect a target data feature (in this case, whether or not someone has heart disease) based on the other data features. This task will introduce you to some of the key machine learning concepts as they pertain to information managers. We will draw from a prominent Python library called Scikit-Learn to do this (Pedregosa et al., 2011).\n",
    "\n",
    "This lab is perhaps the most technically complex of all of the labs (from a theoretical perspective). To help make this simpler, we will explore a relatively simple data set. In fact, it is one of the most commonly explored data sets for this purpose. In many ways, it is also a perfect example of how information managers could help improve researchers' data governance and knowledge discovery processes. If you are interested in exploring this subject further, I am always happy to take on students for directed studies on data mining or machine learning projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "**This week, we will achieve the following objectives:**\n",
    "- Explore the factors that indicate heart disease\n",
    "- Apply a classifier\n",
    "- Compare and assess the performance of multiple classifiers\n",

    "# Case: The Heart Disease Dataset\n",
    "This week's lab is based on the [UCI Heart Disease Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Heart+Disease) provided by David Aha. The dataset consists of 303 records of patient data collected in the 1980s, as described by Detrano et al. (1989), Aha & Kibler (n.d.) and Gennari et al. (1989). Though the original records collected comprehensive data from patients, the original fields have been corrupted, and only a limited selection of data remain in the repository (_this_ is why we should teach kids to back up their data... you just never know). The 303 patient records that remain consist of the following data features:\n",
    "\n",
    "- age: The person's age in years\n",
    "- sex: The person's sex (1 = male, 0 = female)\n",
    "- cp: The chest pain experienced (Value 1: typical angina, Value 2: atypical angina, Value 3: non-anginal pain, Value 4: asymptomatic)\n",
    "- trestbps: The person's resting blood pressure (mm Hg on admission to the hospital)\n",
    "- chol: The person's cholesterol measurement in mg/dl\n",
    "- fbs: The person's fasting blood sugar (> 120 mg/dl, 1 = true; 0 = false)\n",
    "- restecg: Resting electrocardiographic measurement (0 = normal, 1 = having ST-T wave abnormality, 2 = showing probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy by Estes' criteria)\n",
    "- thalach: Maximum heart rate achieved\n",
    "- exang: Exercise induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no)\n",
    "- oldpeak: ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest\n",
    "- slope: the slope of the peak exercise ST segment (Value 1: upsloping, Value 2: flat, Value 3: downsloping)\n",
    "- ca: The number of major vessels (0-3)\n",
    "- thal: A blood disorder called thalassemia (0 = fixed defect; 1 = normal defect; 2 = reversable defect __Note:__ changed for our class for simplicity)\n",
    "- target: Heart disease (0 = no, 1 = yes)\n",
    "\n",
    "This data set has been the subject of hundreds of publications, and all of them (to the best of my knowledge) concern the summarized data similar to that contained in this week's class file."

    "This data set is real and interesting. As a data scientist, one of the first things that you would normally do is explore the data set to understand the nuances of the data. Visualization is best suited for this task, hence why we spent so much time on it. Let's start by importing seaborn and exploring the data head."

As mentioned in the introduction, our goal is to build an algorithm that can predict whether or not a patient has heart disease, based on their health data. As such, the first thing we should do is observe the number of target variables, which are the indicators of whether someone actually has heart disease. We will find that this data consists of 165 records of patients who were diagnosed with heart disease (`target == 1`) and 138 records of patients who did not have heart disease (`target == 0`). "

It is well known that your heart rate maximum decreases as you age, though people with heart disease also have higher heart rates. A simple way to explore these relationships could be to create a scatter plot that visualizes these three factors. The plot below uses seaborn to achieve this."

    "#### Using stats to assess factors\n",
    "It looks like there may be a relationship between these factors, perhaps most notably, `maximum_heart_rate`. This data is structured in a way that we could easily compare the distribution of our samples, similarly to Lab 7. For example, we could observe the Pearson correlation of `maximum_heart_rate` and `age` to determine whether these are correlated. The code below executes this correlation; they are moderately negatively correlated (as expected) with a very low p-value, suggesting that the correlation is significant. "

    "#### Visualizing nominal variables\n",
    "One of the differences between this data set and what we have seen before is that there are many nominal variables (e.g. variables that are categories). In this case, `thalassemia` indicates one of three states: 0: it has been fixed, 1: the patient has it and 2: that it is \"reversable\". I am not qualified to speak more about this beyond speculation, though the [literature](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/0002914989905249) suggests that this is a relevant predictor. \n",

    "We're now ready to start exploring classification. The concept of classification is far more difficult than the code that supports it, so please consider watching the _Introduction to Machine Learning_ video linked on Brightspace. This is the \"Colin's Notes\" (*chough* not Coles Notes) version.\n",

    "Algorithms are a series of logical steps used to complete a task. The computer programs that you write in Python are algorithms; your computer interprets these and executes them. However, when it comes to larger or non-obvious data sets, it is impossible to explicitly tell your computer what to do. Last week, for example, we had 500 000 records of e-commerce transactions. Imagine having to sort through 500 000 records to find out which ones were related! _Not going to happen_.\n",

    "Fortunately, we have machine learning. The goal of machine learning is to create algorithms that accomplish tasks without explicitly programed (Grimson, 2017). To do this, machine learning uses a special set of \"machine learning algorithms\" to _fit_ to a set of data.

This algorithm might be fairly familiar to you; the goal of Random Forest is to create a series of decisions similarly to a flow chart. The algorithm essetnailly observes the data and determines a series of rules that are best suited to classifying the data based on the information gained by the decision tree. When we specify a Random Forest classifier, we can specify the number of rules that it looks for by adjusting the `n_estimators` variable, among others.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Load the classifier\n",
    "The first thing that we will need to do is load the classifier. We can do this by loading Scikit-Learn's `RandomForestClassifier` object from its `ensamble` library. We will save the classifier as `clf`."
