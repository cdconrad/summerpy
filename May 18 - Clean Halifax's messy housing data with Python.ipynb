    "# May 18 - Clean Halifax's messy housing data with Python\n",

    "\n",
    "Welcome to the second week of SummerPy! Last time we explored how to get started with your Jupyter environment. This week, we will work towards something useful: data processing with CSV files. If you are like me (i.e. don't have a formal technical undergrad) you may feel that this week's exercise covers a lot of ground. That's because it does... the concepts that we will explore are essentially what you would teach in a first year, first semester Python course. I chose this approach because I wanted to teach you something useful right away, and after all, there are no grades here; be sure to check out some of the extra materials such as [Sweigart (2020)](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/) if you need extra material. \n",
    "\n",
    "**This week, we will achieve the following objectives:**\n",
    "- Get a csv file into Python\n",
    "- Navigate your data by processing `lists`\n",
    "- Clean data using `if` statements\n",
    "- Clean all of your data using `for` loops\n",
    "- Write your cleaned csv file\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this session you should have some idea of how Python is valuable for data validation and processing."

    "# Case: Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation\n",
    "The [Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy19rwKFGYk#action=share) is a crown corporation with a mandate to assist housing for Canadians. Founded shortly after the second world war, its purpose was once to find housing for veterans. Now it provides programs for making mortgages more affordable and enforces policies designed to make rent more accessible. The CMHC also provides data on rental affordability, including [information on the average price of rent](https://www03.cmhc-schl.gc.ca/hmip-pimh/en#TableMapChart/0580/3/Halifax%20CMA) for various regions in Halifax through its information portal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Like most information portals, CMHC's is built to make the most important information accessible. This has the unfortunate consequence of also making it difficult to retrieve the data that you need. To retrieve rental price data, you must first select your appropriate data boundary and then select `Primary Rental Market` and `Average Rent ($)`. You can then download data in csv format, similar to the `2021_10_Halifax_Rental.csv` provided to you if you wish.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data provided by CMHC is not formatted in a way that is conducive to data science. They provide data in rows and columns, complete with notes at the bottom of the file. It would be desirable to prepare the data in a way that is appropriate for analysis. If we were able to do it in Python, we could sort through hundreds of CSV spreadsheets, such as the rental data for October of each preceding year. Finally, if you are interested in learning more about the CMHC data collection methods, you can [learn more here](https://www.cmhc-schl.gc.ca/en/professionals/housing-markets-data-and-research/housing-research/surveys/methods/methodology-rental-market-survey).

    "Before we can get started with data science earnestly, we need to know more about one last core Python feature: **libraries**. One of the main advantages of Python versus many other programming languages is that it is high level and highly portable. This is to say that you can do a lot with Python in a few lines of code. One of the main things that makes this possible are Python's libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "In programming, a library is a collection of pre-defined routines that you can import into your code without writing them. These greatly accelerate the time that it takes to finish a programming task, and in some cases, save you years of work. Just like libraries designed for humans, Python programming libraries are generally curated by groups of people who ensure that the library is usable. As a free and open source programming language, experienced developers will often create and curate libraries for free, sometimes at great expense of their time!\n",
    "\n",
    "[Python's csv library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html) is a fantastic resource for reading and writing csv files. This one takes a little getting used to, so it is better to simply give an example of its basic use and then explain it.
